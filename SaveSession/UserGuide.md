# Map Sessions


## Introduction

The Save Session tool allows users to save the current map settings into a session and restore them again later. A saved session includes the extent, visible layers, and graphics (markup) of the current map. Sessions may be saved and loaded from files so they can be shared with others. Users can also enable startup Sessions to automatically restore their session when returning to the site.
